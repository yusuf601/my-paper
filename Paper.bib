	abstract = {A novel procedure to perform fuzzy clustering of multivariate time series generated from diﬀerent dependence models is proposed. Diﬀerent amounts of dissimilarity between the generating models or changes on the dynamic behaviours over time are some arguments justifying a fuzzy approach, where each series is associated to all the clusters with speciﬁc membership levels. Our procedure considers quantile-based cross-spectral features and consists of three stages: (i) each element is characterized by a vector of proper estimates of the quantile cross-spectral densities, (ii) principal component analysis is carried out to capture the main diﬀerences reducing the eﬀects of the noise, and (iii) the squared Euclidean distance between the ﬁrst retained principal components is used to perform clustering through the standard fuzzy C-means and fuzzy C-medoids algorithms. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in a broad simulation study where several types of generating processes are considered, including linear, nonlinear and dynamic conditional correlation models. Assessment is done in two diﬀerent ways: by directly measuring the quality of the resulting fuzzy partition and by taking into account the ability of the technique to determine the overlapping nature of series located equidistant from well-deﬁned clusters. The procedure is compared with the few alternatives suggested in the literature, substantially outperforming all of them whatever the underlying process and the evaluation scheme. Two speciﬁc applications involving air quality and ﬁnancial databases illustrate the usefulness of our approach.},

Ketahanan pangan menjadi isu penting yang harus diperhatikan akhir-akhir ini guna mewujudkan salah satu tujuan SDGs. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengelompokkan provinsi-provinsi di Indonesia berdasarkan karakteristik indikator ketahanan pangan dan membandingkan beberapa metode untuk mendapatkan metode pengelompokan yang terbaik. Metode-metode yang dibandingkan yaitu hard clustering (K-Means dan K-Medoids) dan soft clustering (Fuzzy C-Means). Data yang digunakan adalah data sekunder 34 provinsi di Indonesia tahun 2021 dari Badan Pusat Statistik dan lembaga lainnya. Hasil penelitian ini menemukan bahwa metode K-Means merupakan metode terbaik dalam pengelompokan provinsi-provinsi di Indonesia menurut tingkat ketahanan pangannya. Metode ini membentuk dua klaster yang mayoritas provinsi-provinsi di Indonesia memiliki ketahanan pangan. Klaster pertama terdiri dari 8 provinsi dengan tingkat kerawanan pangan, sedangkan klaster kedua terdiri dari 26 provinsi dengan tingkat ketahanan pangan.},

	abstract = {Understanding and mitigating the spatial and temporal volatility of agricultural commodity prices remains a critical yet challenging task. Fluctuations in food and agricultural commodity prices exacerbate food insecurity and impact farmers worldwide. This research examines the impact of road network measures on the volatility of agricultural commodity prices. We utilized monthly price data from the FAO Food Price Monitoring and Analysis Tool, which encompasses 236 markets across 60 countries, for eight food groups comprising 36 commodity categories, from 2015 to 2023. For each market, we constructed road network measures, including road density, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality, using data from the Global Roads Inventory Project and a 2015 population density raster, both gridded at 2.5 arcminutes. The regression results show that markets located near denser, better-connected road networks tend to exhibit lower food price volatility. However, the local advantages of road networks on price stability vary significantly depending on the food group and specific network measures: bread and oil markets tend to be destabilized by centralization, while beans and vegetables are stabilized. No consistent or statistically significant effects are observed for grains, roots, or animal food groups across all network centrality measures. Findings highlight the complex and heterogeneous relationship between transportation infrastructure and food price volatility, as well as the need for regionally and commodity specific infrastructure policies to mitigate food price volatility.},

The dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), and heterogeneous non-causality approaches were used. The results showed the presence of a long-term relationship between food prices and inflation volatilities. Furthermore, it was noted that chili, rice, shallot, and garlic prices had a positive impact on inflation volatility, but chicken prices had a negative effect. The empirical results also suggested that central and local governments need to stabilize food prices to minimize inflation fluctuation. When the data were split before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, the results showed there was a significant difference in the effect of chili, rice, shallot, and chicken prices volatility on inflation volatility.},

	abstract = {Food price volatility is a persistent challenge in Indonesia, where agriculture is central to food security and rural livelihoods. While price transmission has been studied, little is known about how volatility spreads sub-nationally in archipelagic economies with fragmented infrastructure. This study applies a Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH) model to monthly rural producer price data from 2009 to 2022 for six commodities: rice, chicken, eggs, chili, cayenne, and shallots. Results show that Java functions as the core volatility transmitter, with long-run conditional correlations exceeding 0.92 in Sumatra, 0.91 in Kalimantan, and 0.90 in Papua, reflecting strong and persistent co-movements. Even in low-production regions such as Maluku, significant volatility linkages reveal structural dependence on Java. Volatility clustering is particularly intense for perishables like chili and shallots. The findings highlight the need for spatially differentiated stabilization policies, including upstream interventions in Java and cooperative-based storage systems in outer islands. This study is the first to apply a DCC-GARCH framework to rural producer price data in an archipelagic context, capturing volatility transmission across regions. Its novelty lies in linking these spillovers with regional market dependence, offering new empirical evidence and actionable insights for designing inclusive and geographically responsive food security strategies.},
